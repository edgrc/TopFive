# TopFive 🎡
Top Five is a cooperative game 🎲 in which one player must guess the score given by the other player using the word they provided.

For example, a player who chooses 5 will give a word on any theme that has a score of 5/5.
The other player must then guess the score based on that word.



This version was something i created to play with my friends on Discord initially without it being interactive and without online hosting.
